    <h2>The Godfather of Artificial Intelligence</h2><br>
    <p>
      Alan Turing is probably the most famous Cryptographer in history. He is definitely the only cryptographer to lead a team of English logicians under wartime conditions to break the cipher behind Germany’s original “unbreakable code” during world War II, the Enigma code. As a result, he was also directly responsible for the sinking of a lot of Nazi U-boats, all of which is the type of thing that makes a person pretty famous. Therefore, when speaking of the all-too-short life of Alan Turing, it is usually only mentioned second that he is the godfather of both the computer and artificial intelligence.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      He penned some of the most important early papers in these brand new (at the time) fields, literally establishing many of the building blocks in Computer Science. He designed the world’s first stored-program computer, or what we think of today as simply “a computer”, as well as writing a very early paper describing a “Turing Machine”, a paper upon which John Von Neumann would use as the basis to invent the architecture behind microchips. He even beat Von Neumann to the stored-program computer, who had only managed to eke out partial design of the same thing the year before. Turing was also one of the greatest mathematicians in human history, proving without a shadow of a doubt that some people are simply genius.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      On the subject of computers, Turing’s most famous papers is called Computing Machinery and Intelligence [1], a brilliant piece written about computer learning. This paper  was the first to ask the question “could a computer think”, and Turing came to that, in theory, yes they could. In “Computer Machinery”, Alan Turing also changed the face of AI even by inventing the The Turing Test, the one and only criteria used today universally to judge whether a program/application/AI can pass as human. Explaining that most definitions of “think” are entirely too ephemeral to judge with repeatable metrics, he devised the test as a standardized method for deciding the quality of AI. Today, the Turing Test is the single most-used method for judging whether a program/application/AI can “pass as human”.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Turing envisioned his test, called The Imitation Game (also the name of the great movie about his life[2]), a game which takes place with two humans and one artificial intelligence computer, all three of which are in separate rooms and can only communicating via written communication. One moderator could ask the other two as many questions as they liked, until this moderator thought they knew which one respondee was the computer. If the computer lasted more than five minutes without the moderator guessing their identity, or if they guess wrong, the computer passes the test.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      These days, the Turing Test has mostly dropped the game aspect, and instead stands as shorthand for a computer which “can pass for human to an average person” or, more honestly “passes for human to me”. It is not uncommon for the media to use Turing Test in articles[3] about artificial intelligence or machine learning, if nothing else because it’s a criteria that makes sense to their readers. If it sounds like a human enough that it fools you, it passes the test.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Alan Turing set a high bar for artificial intelligence that, nonetheless, seemed very achievable to him. In fact, he thought that the main roadblock to achieving true AI was processing power, a proposition we will come to see is far from complete. He thought that by the twenty-first century we would have machines that mimic human thought patterns and language well enough to fool us into thinking they were humans. Instead we have Siri, which does not exactly fulfill Turing’s dreams of artificial intelligence.

    <br><h2>Siri is not helpful in a snowstorm</h2><br>
    <p>
      Alan Turing predicted we would have artificial intelligences which could convince us for five minutes straight that they were human. Siri, on the other hand, struggles to open her digital mouth for more than 5 seconds without giving away how non-human and robotic she is, which I learned first-hand while on a road trip.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I was in the middle-of-nowhere Pennsylvania in my hatchback Honda Civic, driving New York to Chicago back from a Thanksgiving holiday weekend, on the I-80 which had been cleared of snow so recently you could see the treadmarks from the plow. I was driving alone, and had the foresight to plan my entertainment in great detail, but not to avoid the storm. I was listening to podcasts (How DId this Get Made and Doug Loves Movies), an audiobook (Parallel Worlds by Michio Kaku), and music, and I wanted to a way to toggle between all of these while minimizing my time spent looking at the screen. Naturally, Siri came to mind, and as I had the new iPhone this seemed like a natural solution. After all, wasn’t Siri some kind of tool that could control apps and do search? That’s what I had heard, at least.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I then went through a scenario that might seem familiar to many of you readers. I waited until I would soon need to make my first gas stop, and cued Siri by holding down the big center button. I was encouraged to feel the familiar haptic double-tap that iPhone’s give when they want you to feel comfortably-alerted that you might need to do something.
    </p><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Siri, how far is the closest gas station?&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Searching &#39;closest gas station&#39; in Bing.&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <p>
      I had triggered a search, something which I (rightly) guessed was a default response when Siri doesn’t understand an explicit command. But no I was stuck with Bing opening a page filled with wikipedia articles about gas stations, and only a fuzzy understanding of how to get back to Siri’s home screen to correct the mistake.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      Also, Bing? Siri uses Bing?
    </p><br>
    <p>
      I was starting to get a bad feeling about this whole thing. I went back to the home screen, holding down the center button again to get int Siri’s home screen.
    </p><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;No no, Siri, where is the closest gas station?&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Searching, &#39;Closet gasket shove&#39; in Bing.&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <p>
      Obviously, I needed an alternative approach, as either Siri could not access Apple’s Map App to search for gas stations while inside it’s home screen, or would not do so for me. Since Apple maps was proprietary, and driving directions must be one of the most important early use cases for Siri’s voice technology, Siri must work with this app, right? “Right”, I told myself optimistically, as I saw my gas gauge dip below the red line.
    </p><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Siri, open gas station in maps, please.&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Opening &#39;station maps&#39; in Bing&#39;.&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <p>
      I added the please, figuring it couldn’t hurt. After all, when I swore at Siri (admit it, you do it too) she pretended to get miffed with me. If she could get her feelings hurt, I thought, maybe a “please” would help her feel good about herself, so she would try extra hard to solve my gas station issue.
    </p><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Siri, search &#39;gas stations&#39; in Apple Maps&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <blockquote>
      &#34;Opening Maps&#34;
    </blockquote><br>
    <p>
      Finally, we were getting somewhere! I got immediately excited, and waited for a safe opportunity to take a peek at the screen. A car blew by me and when I finally saw no one ahead or behind me, took a look. Ugh! Nothing about gas stations of any kind, Siri had just opened Apple Maps to my last search (which was for Dunkin Donuts in the Chicago Loop). Clearly, there was a major failure to communicate between me and Siri.
    </p><br>
    <p>
      This experience, and others, inspired a serious interest in voice technology, and subsequently the deeper question of interaction between humans and machine intelligence. I am a linguist by education and software programmer by trade, so I had some tools at my disposal. But I would discover that there are no easy answers to the fascinating questions raised by people from Alan Turing to Bill Gates.
